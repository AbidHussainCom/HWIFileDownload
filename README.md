HWIFileDownload
===============

HWIFileDownload provides a clear interface for integrating file download on iOS. It is based on NSURLSession so it offers system background operation even when the app is not running. HWIFileDownload is backwards compatible down to iOS 6 (where NSURLConnection is used instead of NSURLSession).
